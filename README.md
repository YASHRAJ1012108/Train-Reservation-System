Introduction

The Train Reservation System is a Python-based project designed to manage train ticket bookings efficiently. The system allows users to sign up, view available trains, book or cancel tickets, and track transaction history using the PNR number. It also includes an admin panel where administrators can add, delete, and update train details, as well as monitor revenue for each train.

This project uses Python for the backend and MySQL for data storage, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience.
